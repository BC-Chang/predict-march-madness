    "The following workflow uses data that is openly available for the \"March Machine Learning Mania 2021 - NCAAM\" competition on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021/data). Details of the datasets are contained in the \"Data\" landing page. The features I will use are summarized below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into two \"stages.\" Stage 1 contains NCAA Men's Basketball data from 1985-2020 and Stage 2 contains the same sets of data for the 2021 season. For the first iteration of this workflow, we will establish a baseline model prediction using the win-loss and margin of victory/loss for each tournament team. For the baseline model, I will fit a logistic regression model to find the likelihood of a team winning its tournament matchup. The next draft will include more comprehensive feature selection and model training with more complex input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we will use for this draft iteration include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *MTeams.csv*: Include team IDs and the years they played in their first tournament\n",

    "* *MSeasons.csv*: Year-by-year historical date information for the tournaments, including the dates the tournmanet starts, and the regions of the tournament in a given year\n",
    "* *MNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv*: Game-by-game tournament results for all seasons. Includes the round a game was played (based on DayNum), winning/losing team, and final scores\n",
    "* *MNCAATourneySeeds.csv*: Identifies the seeds for all teams in the tournament, for all seasons.\n",
    "* *MRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv*: Game-by-game regular season results for all seasons starting in 1985. Contains the date the game was played (based on DayNum), winning/losing teams,  final scores, relative location of the winning team (home, away, neutral site), and number of overtime periods played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features used in the first iteration of this workflow are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```Tournament Seeds``` - Tournment seeding for each team, for each year, as determined by the NCAA tournament selection committee; unitless\n",
    "* ```Winning score``` - Average number of points scored in a win ; points\n",
    "* ```Losing score``` - Average number of points scored in a  loss ; points\n",
    "* ```Win ratio``` - Number of games won / Total number of games played ; fraction\n",
    "* ```Score Gap``` - Cumulative margin of victory - Cumulative margin of loss, normalized by total number of games played; points/game\n",
    "* ```Score Gap Differential``` - Difference in score gap between the two teams in the tournament matchup ; points/game\n",
    "* ```Win Ratio Differential``` - Difference in win ratio between the two teams in the tournament matchup ; fraction\n",
